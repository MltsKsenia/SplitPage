Project Name: SplitPage
Team Members: Maltseva Ksenia and Irina K

1. Overall Impression:

2. Technical Implementation:
- The authentication was implemented very well and is a very good feature to have at this point.
- very good use of SQL and node.js.

3. User Experience:
The CSS is very simple and might needs to be improved, But is sufficient for now.

4. Strengths:
the project works well. The authentication is advanced for this stage.

5. Areas for Improvement:
- There are some bugs. like that the page displays "owed" regardless what you pick, and when you add a new expense the HTML itself will be displayed as a string.
- The comments and errors are in russian, which makes it difficult to understand what is happening. It's common courtesy to write these in english for an international audience.
- Main.js is far too long and can be cut into smaller pieces. This will help with the performance and debugging, and will boost the overall readability of the code.

1. Final Thoughts:
Very good project. Some bugs need to be fixed.
